# ideation-train

**Designed as a daily ideation challenge, ideation-train is a platform where same-day visitors have the opportunity to respond to the same ideation prompt, give feedback, and receive feedback from other users.** 

Users can choose to answer a prompt with a drawing or through text. Once the user has submitted their idea, they can choose to give feedback on another user's idea submission for the same prompt that day. Feedback can be given with a drawing or through text â€” with the goal to ideate on top of the original idea or give constructive feedback. Users can only receive feedback on their own submission if they've given feedback to another user's submission.

This application is intended for users who like to exercise their design and ideation daily while also having the opportunity to give and receive feedback from other users.

Ideation prompts are motivated by the United Nations' 5th Sustainability Development Goal, Gender Equality. These prompts aim to encourage the ideation of products/devices/systems that empower women and protect their safety in public and private spaces.

*ideation-train is an application built with React that was developed over the course of HCDE 438 Web Technologies (WINTER 2022).*
